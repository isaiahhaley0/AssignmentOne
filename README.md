## Authored By: Isaiah Haley and Ethan Walton

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate all knowledge gained from Web Application Development class 
and be able to apply all elements of learning to our Final Project in which we will be able to run a Social Media 
web application of our own designed from the bottom up.

In Part 1 of our illusive project we have worked to be able to define all aspects that have been asked of in the project and also have went above and beyond in overall design. We went for a very trendy retro vibe which brings the reasoning behind the name of our social web application 'Vibez'. This has been implemented so far to include dynamic responsitivity in the form of including JavaScript functionality to be able to dynamically work with components throughout the web application. In part 1 of this project we have implemented a base html and css composition of many of the main components that will be working to serve our application. An example of some of these for example are the Vibez search page, homepage, base profile pages, signup page, and sign-in page as well. These components are serving to be able to compose our base html pages so far that make up our Vibez web application that is a retro Twitter-esk application. The logo is homemade along with the name to be able to simply bring chill vibez across our entire platfrm

Part 2 of our retro-active web app Vibez, is bringing forth a much more dynamic approach to be able to include form validation when new users are signing up to create a Vibez account and also implementing security questions as well to be able to better serve Account restoration in case of a forgotten password at some point in time along the way. Included in the form validation on the sign up page is a way to be able to ensure that all fields are filled out correctly and making sure that there are no invalid characters in any of the text boxes either. Furthermore, this validation also shows any areas that are incorrect with yellow highlighted areas after the web browser alerting has been dismissed as well. This will ensure that all fields can be filled out correctly and also make sure that when our signup form has been submitted that it is going to be a valid user that is signing up. Lastly, once submitting the signup form successfuly and only when submitted successfully will you then be taken to the security question page to be able to fill out security questions to better assist with account recovery if ever needed. These questions serve the purpose of answering them in a manner that will be rememberable and as specified in the task they have been implemented dynamically to be able to show the input box only when you have chosen a question that needs to be answered
